MEMMAP

Purpose: To display all allocated memory blocks, including memory-resident 
         (TSR) programs and their associated environment memory blocks.  
         Optionally, also displays the the variables in each environment block.

Format: MEMMAP [/V]

Remarks: Entered at the DOS prompt without its optional /V parameter, MEMMAP 
         produces a display similar to that shown below:

	Memory                                     MemMap (Version 2, May 89)
	Control     Block Size
	Block        [Bytes]       Owner
	Segment    Hex   Decimal  Segment      Type                Name
	-------  ------- -------  -------  ------------  ---------------------

	Note that under DOS 2.10, 3.3, and the DOS Command subset of OS/2 
        Extended Edition 1.1 some program names will be designated <unknown> 
        that are reported fully under DOS 4.0.  When used under OS/2 EE, DOS 
        identifies itself as DOS 10.10 <kernel>.
	
	Entered with the /V switch, MEMMAP also reports the environmental 
        variables that are loaded with each TSR.  These variables initially 
        loaded by DOS are contained in the first environment block with the 
        name <shell>, as  shown above.  The default size of this block is 160 
        bytes.
